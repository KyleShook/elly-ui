The WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices guide recommends using the following ARIA attributes for `<textarea>` and `<input>` elements:

For `<input>` elements:

- aria-autocomplete: Indicates whether the input value is automatically completed.
- aria-placeholder: Provides a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry.
- aria-readonly: Indicates that the input value cannot be modified by the user.
- aria-required: Indicates that user input is required on the input before a form can be submitted.
  For `<textarea>` elements:

- aria-placeholder: Provides a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry.
- aria-readonly: Indicates that the input value cannot be modified by the user.
- aria-required: Indicates that user input is required on the textarea before a form can be submitted.
  Additionally, you should also use the standard HTML attributes for `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements, such as name, value, placeholder, readonly, disabled, etc. to provide additional information about the input element to the user and to assistive technology.

It's important to note that not all ARIA attributes are appropriate or necessary for every input or textarea element, and you should use them judiciously to ensure that they provide meaningful information and improve the accessibility of your UI.
